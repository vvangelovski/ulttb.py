ulttb.py
========================

A fast implementation of the Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets (LTTB) downsampling algorithm.
It is based on [lttb-py](https://github.com/devoxi/lttb-py) and is over 3 times faster than the pure python implementation.
The algorithm is implemented in Cython and compiled from C.
